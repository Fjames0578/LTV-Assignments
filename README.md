# LTV-Assignments
repo for LTV Block-Chain Smart Contracts in Solidity

What I learned:
 Implement Basic Access Control 
 this ensures that only the contract owner can change the greeting.  
     Declare a state variable to store the owner's address and set it in the constructor.
     A modifier can be used to change the behavior of functions in a declarative way. Here, you'll create a modifier that checks if the caller is the owner.

  Then the functionality can restrict access and emit the  `GreetingChanged`
 I did have compiler issues and did not observe the Logs
